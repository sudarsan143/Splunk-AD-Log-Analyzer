# 🛡️ Splunk AD Log Analyzer 

A complete cybersecurity SIEM project focused on analyzing Windows Active Directory Security Logs (Event ID 4624 & 4625) to detect brute-force attacks, password spray attempts, lateral movement, and abnormal authentication patterns inside an enterprise environment.

This lab uses Splunk to ingest, analyze, visualize, and investigate AD authentication logs generated from real-world-like datasets.
